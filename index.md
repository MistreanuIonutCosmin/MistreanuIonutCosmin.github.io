# About



I am a young and curious engineer who is always looking for new things to learn and problems to solve.

Since my college years, I have worked in different areas of the software industry to compliment my academic knowledge. A few of these areas are full-stack web development, android software development, DevOps engineer and now Machine Learning and Deep Learning. In the past two years, Machine Learning is the thing that keeps me excited and doesn't let me sleep :) .
